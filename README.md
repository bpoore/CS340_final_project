Beer Finder App

PHP/MySQL app for adding and removing beers at locations as well as querying where to find specific beers on tap at locations. Eventually would like to add more features with regard to searching within specifc geographical regions for if the app were to take off in other locations, but currently working to finish the project for the Intro to Databases course at Oregon State. 

As time permits, I intend to come back and add AJAX functionality, but that is not in the scope of the assignment. Focusing on a robust database build and most pleasant user experience possible without utilizing AJAX as of now.
